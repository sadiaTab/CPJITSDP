  <h2>Abstract</h2>
Cross-Project (CP) Just-In-Time Software Defect Prediction (JIT-SDP) makes use of CP data to overcome the lack of data necessary to train well performing JIT-SDP classifiers at the beginning of software projects. However, such approaches have never been investigated in realistic online learning scenarios, where Within-Project (WP) software changes naturally arrive over time and can be used to automatically update the classifiers. We provide the first investigation of when and to what extent CP data are useful for JIT-SDP in such realistic scenarios. For that, we propose three different online CP JIT-SDP approaches that can be updated with incoming CP and WP training examples over time. We also collect data on 9 proprietary software projects and use 10 open source software projects to analyse these approaches. We find that training classifiers with incoming CP+WP data can lead to absolute
improvements in G-mean of up to 53.89% and up to 35.02% at the initial stage of the projects compared to classifiers using WP-only and CP-only data, respectively. Using CP+WP data was also shown to be beneficial after a large number of WP data were received. Using CP data to supplement WP data helped the classifiers to reduce or prevent large drops in predictive performance that may occur over time, leading to absolute G-Mean improvements of up to 37.35% and 48.16% compared to WP-only and CP-only data during such periods, respectively. During periods of stable predictive performance, absolute improvements were of up to 29.03% and up to 41.25% compared to WP-only and CP-only classifiers, respectively. Our results highlight the importance of using both CP and WP data together in realistic online JIT-SDP scenarios.

<h2>To run experiments for Online CPJITSDP</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Go to the directory src/cpjitsdpexperiment</li>
  <li>There are 4 experiment files- ExpAIO, ExpFilter, ExpOPAIO and ExpOPFilter for online cpjitsdp approaches (AIO, Filter, OPAIO and OPFilter, respectively).</li>
  <li>Run appropriate experiment file (i.e. cpjitsdpexperiment.ExpAIO.java)</li>
</ul>

Example command (can be found in the experiment files):

```
CpjitsdpAIO -l (spdisc.meta.WFL_OO_ORB_Oza -i 15 -s "+ens+" -t "+theta+" -w "+waitingTime+" -p "+paramsORB+")  -s  (ArffFileStream -f (/"+datasetsArray[dsIdx]+") -c 15) -e (FadingFactorEachClassPerformanceEvaluator -a 0.99) -f 1 -d results/results.csv"
```
<ul>
  <li>CpjitsdpAIO: Online CPJITSDP approach to run.</li>
  <li>-i 15 - the position of the unixtimestamp of the commit in the arff</li>
  <li>-s - the ensemble size</li>
  <li>-t - the fading factor used for computing the class sizes</li>
  <li>-w - the waiting time for assuming the commit label is available</li>
  <li>-p - the parameters for the ORB.</li>
  <li>Values for -s,-t,-w and -p can be passed as arguments. </li>
  <li>Default values for -s,-t,-w and -p are (20,0.99,90 and 100;0.4;10;12;1.5;3)</li>
</ul>

MOA parameters:
<ul>
  <li>-l the machine learning algorithm to be used.</li>

<li>-s (ArffFileStream -f -c ) is the path to the dataset in arff format, with -c indicating the index of the class label in the dataset file.</li>

<li>-e (FadingFactorEachClassPerformanceEvaluator -a ) is the performance evaluator to be used, with -a indicating the fading factor to be adopted.</li>

<li>-d is the path to the output file where the results of the experiments will be saved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Datasets</h2>
Datasets used in the experiments are in ARFF format. The ARFF file must contain header with the following attributes and must maintain the order of the attributes.

```

    @attribute fix {False,True}
    @attribute ns numeric
    @attribute nd numeric
    @attribute nf numeric
    @attribute entrophy numeric
    @attribute la numeric
    @attribute ld numeric
    @attribute lt numeric
    @attribute ndev numeric
    @attribute age numeric
    @attribute nuc numeric
    @attribute exp numeric
    @attribute rexp numeric
    @attribute sexp numeric
    @attribute contains_bug {False,True}
    @attribute author_date_unix_timestamp numeric
    @attribute project_no numeric
    @attribute commit_type numeric
    @data
    
```

<ul>
<li>
Attributes[1-14]: Software change metrics.</li>
<li>
Attribute[15]: True label of the commit (whether the commit is really defect-inducing or clean).
</li>
<li>
Attribute[16]: Timestamp when the commit was submitted to the repository. 
</li>
<li>Attribute[17]: Index number associated to a project in datasetsArray. This index identifies a given project. Note that the index of the target project must be passed as argument dsIdx in the command line of the algorithm. For example,  if our target project is Tomcat, then dsIdx should be 0. For JGroups, dsIdx should be 1. 

```

  datasetsArray = {"tomcat","JGroups","spring-integration",
		   "camel","brackets","nova","fabric8",
		   "neutron","npm","BroadleafCommerce"
		}
```
  
  </li>
<li>Attribute[18]: commit_type is a number assigned based on the following scenario:
  <ol>
    <li>The commit is not buggy: commit_type 0</li>
    <li>For target project, the commit is buggy but its true label was not found within W days: commit_type 1</li>
    <li>For target project, the commit is buggy and its true label was found within W days: commit_type 2</li>
    <li>For cross projects, the commit is buggy but its true label was not found within W days: commit_type 4</li>
    <li>The true label of a defective commit was assigned (for all projects): commit_type 3</li>
  </ol>
</ul>


<h3> Data processing steps</h3>
Data is processed using the following steps. After the processing, processed data needs to be sorted in ascending order of the timestamp to mainitain the chronology. 

```

For each commit x:
	If x is clean:
		Add an instance with: 
			Software change metrics=Attributes[1-14], contains_bug=False, timestamp=[author_date_unix_timestamp], 
			project_no=relevant project index, commit_type=0
			(If x is from target project:
				Test x as clean at timestamp=[author_date_unix_timestamp]
			For both target and cross-projects, train x as clean at timestamp=[author_date_unix_timestamp]+[W days (converted into unix_timestamp)])
	If x is buggy:
		If days_to_first_fix > W:
			Add an instance for training with:
					Software change metrics=Attributes[1-14], contains_bug=True, 
					timestamp=[author_date_unix_timestamp]+[days_to_first_fix (converted into unix_timestamp)], 
					project_no=relevant project index, commit_type=3
					
			If x is from target project:	
				Add an instance for training with:
					Software change metrics=Attributes[1-14], contains_bug=False, 
					timestamp=[author_date_unix_timestamp]+[W days (converted into unix_timestamp)], 
					project_no=relevant project index, commit_type=0
				Add an instance for testing with:
					Software change metrics=Attributes[1-14], contains_bug=True, timestamp=[author_date_unix_timestamp], project_no=relevant project index, commit_type=1
							
			If x is not from target project:
				Add an instance for training with:
					Software change metrics=Attributes[1-14], contains_bug=False, 
					timestamp=[author_date_unix_timestamp]+[W days (converted into unix_timestamp)], project_no=relevant project index, commit_type=4
						
		If days_to_first_fix <= W:
			Add an instance for training with :
					Software change metrics=Attributes[1-14], contains_bug=True, 
					timestamp=[author_date_unix_timestamp]+[days_to_first_fix (converted into unix_timestamp)], 
					project_no=relevant project index, commit_type=3
			If x is from target project:
				Add an instance for testing with :
					Software change metrics=Attributes[1-14], contains_bug=True, timestamp=[author_date_unix_timestamp], 
					project_no=relevant project index, commit_type=2
					

```
